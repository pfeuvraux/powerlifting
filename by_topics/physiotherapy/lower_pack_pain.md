# Lower back pain

_I am not a physiotherapist, and might use the wrong terminologies,
consult with an actual practitioner prior to proceeding to any of these_.

**_Status_: fixed**

As a former rower, I've had injuries around the lower back
for quite some time and with high pain intensities as well.

Getting into powerlifting revived these discomforts and pains (not that they
were gone at all), and prevented me from actually trusting myself
(in using my back during lifts). This impacted my motivation, performances,
sleep, and hence my overall physical health.

## Symptoms

* Couldn't sit for more than 20 minutes without feeling
utter discomfort
* Weakness and swelling around the lumbar spinae erectors
at all times (not only during lifts)
* Mentally challenging to perform a lumbar flexion,
but not physically impossible

## Treatment

### Initial approach

I performed lumbar extensions, which instantly helped, but didn't provide the
expected long-term soothing effect. While working on my desk, I had then taken
the habit to get up and perform lumbar extensions for as long as it could help
me stay sat down. I would do extensions maybe about 3 times an hour.

Over time (a couple of weeks), I had instantly gained a lot of flexibility.
But I started to notice that I hadn't gained as much mobility.

I also initially challenged my pain by performing back flexions, which
helped not only mentally, but also physically as the pain used to decrease sightly.

### Getting external views

My physio practitioner initially came up with the following:

* Barbell side bending
* Hip hitch exercise

I started with _barbell side bending_, which initally helped a lot but
wasn't enough. The pain was gone, but the discomfort remained.

### Getting my spinae erectors stronger

Back when I was rowing, I used to perform cleans (from the Clean and Jerk)
to work on my explosiveness.
I noticed that while doing those, all pain and discomfort would be gone.

I then started to hammer light cleans (50kg) for 10 minutes twice or three times
a week, and started to get better, but it wasn't enough to fully help.

I noticed that my strength work for my spinae erectors mainly consisted of
isometric work, but not any concentric or excentric work.

I started to perform back extensions without any weights with an accent
on the range of motion. This started to finally help a lot more.

## Prevention

Proceeding to the following prevention program has mostly kept me
out of pain and discomfort.

3 to 5 times a week:

* **Back extensions**
    * 15kg; 9 reps; 3 series or
    * 10kg; 16 reps; 3 or 4 series
* **Barbell side bending**:
    * 40kg; +-20 reps; 3 series or
    * 50kg; 13 reps; 3 series
    * _Note: dumbells can also be used_
* **Back foam rolling**:
    * Before and after any training or physio session

## Final thoughts

This is a very effective method, even though the discomfort remains
after sitting too long as I do heaving lifting through powerlifting.

I find myself closing even bench traning session with back extension
exercises as they really help in preventing any pain to come back.

Foam rolling has helped relieve any discomfort and it is always the first
thing I do when I reach the gym.
